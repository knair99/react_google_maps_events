# About
An intro to using react, redux, axios, jsonp, promises and a plethora of event and maps API. The app is designed for getting information about events happening close to you and illustrating how to plot them on google maps, using third party libraries like react-google-maps.

# Caveat
For extending or working on this, replace any instance of 'YOUR_KEY_HERE' with a valid key.
Keys required: (Google Places, Google Maps, Eventbrite, Eventful, Predict, etc).

# Instructions
Run 'npm install' from the root directory first to install all the node packages from package.json.
Then, run 'npm start'.
